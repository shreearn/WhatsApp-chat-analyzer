## Description
WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is a Python script that analyzes chat logs exported from WhatsApp to generate various statistics about the chat, such as the number of messages sent by each user, the most active time of day, and the most frequently used words. This tool is useful for gaining insights into group conversations or personal chats, tracking individual participation levels, and identifying the sentiments of the messages.
